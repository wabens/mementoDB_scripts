# Scripts for MementoDB
Purpose of this project is to rebuild a MementoDB and fix bugs and performance issues relating to scripts which are used on top of the MementoDB 'flexible database manager'. Memento provides a flexible UI and a myriad of fields, data types and input methods. While scripts, written in JavaScript, provide additional functionality.
